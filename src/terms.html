        Confidential Information is essential to this Agreement and is a condition to Licensee's use and possession of
        the Drawings. Licensee will retain all Confidential Information in strict confidence and not disclose it to any
        third party (except as authorized by this Agreement) or use it in any way except as permitted by this Agreement
        without RI's express written consent. The prohibitions contained in this Section 5.1 preclude dissemination of

        otherwise not in violation of RI's rights; or 5.2.4 is required to be disclosed pursuant to law, regulation, or
        court order provided, however, that Licensee gives RI prompt, written notice in order to allow RI to take
        whatever action it deems necessary to protect its Confidential Information.<br>5.3 Confidentiality Agreement
        <br>Without limiting the foregoing, prior to any independent contractor's gaining access to any of RI's
        Confidential Information, such independent contractor will enter into a confidentiality agreement with Licensee
        on the same terms and conditions as those in Section 5.1, above. Further, Licensee will require all of its
        independent contractors to assign to Licensee all right, title and interest in any work or materials created by
        such independent contractor and based on the Drawings and in which Licensee or independent contractor claims any
        proprietary or intellectual property rights. Licensee will be fully responsible for the authorized conduct of
        all its employees, agents and representatives who may in any way breach this Agreement.<br>5.4 Irreparable Harm
        By Disclosure<br>Licensee recognizes and acknowledges that the Confidential Information may have competitive
        value and that irreparable damage may result to RI if Licensee improperly discloses Confidential Information to
        any non-authorized third party.<br><br>Article 6: Miscellaneous<br>6.1 Assignment<br>Licensee may not assign
        this Agreement or any rights or obligation hereunder, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise,

        foregoing, Licensee may assign this Agreement to a successor to all or substantially all of its business or
        assets to which this Agreement relates, and Licensee will have the right to transfer its rights hereunder to any
        company which is wholly owned by Licensee; provided that, such successor or wholly owned subsidiary agrees in
        writing to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement that are applicable to Licensee.<br>6.2
        Notices<br>Any notices or other communications required to be given pursuant to this Agreement will be in
        writing and will be effective upon delivery by hand or upon receipt if sent by mail (registered or certified
        mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested) or by express mail or overnight courier or upon transmission if
        sent by telex or facsimile (with request for confirmation of receipt in a manner customary for communications of
        such respective type), except that if notice is received by email or facsimile after 5:00 P.M. on a business day
        at the place of receipt, it will be effective as of the following business day. Notices will be delivered to the
        addresses set forth in the agreement.<br>Any party may change its address for receiving notice by written notice
        given to the other party in the manner provided above.<br>6.3 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction and
        Venue<br>In all respects, including all matters of construction, validity and performance, this Agreement and
        the obligations set forth hereunder will be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws

        and federal courts located in the County of Santa Clara, State of California will have in personam jurisdiction
        and venue over such party for the purpose of litigating any such dispute, controversy, or proceeding arising out
        of related to this Agreement.<br>6.4 Severability<br>If any term or provision of this Agreement will be found to
        be void or contrary to law, such term or provision will, but only to the extent necessary to bring this
        Agreement within the requirements of law, be deemed to be severable from the other terms and provisions hereof,
        and the remainder of this Agreement will be given effect as if the parties had not included the severed term
        herein.<br>6.5 Survival<br>The provisions of Articles 2, 3, and 5 will survive the termination of this
        Agreement. <br>6.6 Waiver<br>The waiver of, or failure to enforce, any breach or default hereunder will not
        constitute the waiver of any other or subsequent breach or default.<br>6.7 Headings<br>The section and other
        headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and will not affect any way the meaning or
        interpretation of this Agreement.<br>6.8 Entire Agreement<br>This Agreement sets forth the entire Agreement
